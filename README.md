# RDNA3-archdriver-install
Simple script to install Mesa 23 to arch linux. Arch uses llvm 14 but Mesa 23 needs llvm 16 to compile. This script will install llvm 16 as well as Mesa and Mesa-git and compile them.

Just run the install script and wait for everything to compile and reboot. 

CONGRADULATIONS! you now have a working graphcs card.
